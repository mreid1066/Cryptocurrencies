# Cryptocurrencies with Unsupervised Machine Learning
## Overview
We were tasked with creating a Unsupervised ML model to help analyze the vast ammount of cryptocurrency options. Specifically we were asked to create a classification model to group similar cryptocurrencies based on key measures.

## Analysis
To meet our objectives, we had to preprocess the data by cleaning up the dataset and removing columns and rows that were not beneficial to our analysis. WE then had to fit the model into clusters and then we graphed the results using different methods.
